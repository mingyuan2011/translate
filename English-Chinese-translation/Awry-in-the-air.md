Pollution
Awryin the sky
中国上空的五十度灰
 
AT NANYAWO elementary school in Hebei province, near Beijing, the temperature in early December fell below freezing, both outside and in. The teachers took to instructing the six-year-old children in the playground. At least outside it was sunny. The classrooms were unusable because the local government had dismantled the coal-fired boilers for environmental reasons, but not yet installed a replacement heating system. There have been several such incidents this winter in
northern China. In Linfen, in neighbouring Shanxi province, villagers say their coal-fired heater shave been taken away but the pipes linking them to the gas system have not arrived. A new slogan recently appeared on walls in the town: “If you burn coal, we’ll see you in the detention centre.”

靠近北京的河北省的南雅握小学，在12月初时，无论室内还是室外的气温都降至冰点。老师们在操场上训练一些六岁的孩子。至少室外有太阳。教室已经不能用了，因为当地政府因为环境原因把烧煤的锅炉给拆了，但并没有安装可替代的供热系统。在中国的北方的这个冬天已经发生了几起这样的事件了。在临汾，隔壁山西省的一个村庄，他们的烧煤的供热装置已经被移走了，但是连接到天然气的管道还没送到。在县城里，一条新的标语写在墙上：“谁烧煤就抓谁。”

The authorities in northern China have imposed emergency restrictions until mid-March to control air pollution, which spikes during the winter. Twenty-six cities plus Beijing and Tianjin (which count as provinces) had promised to replace heating systems that run on coal with ones using electricity or gas for 3m households this year. But they failed to complete the work on time, forcing a rare U-turn: they have allowed a certain amount of coal to be burned in places without any alternative. The government has also limited the output of iron, steel and aluminium smelters, mothballed many big construction projects—leaving cranes atop unfinished sky-scrapers motionless against cornflower skies—and, in Beijing and its surroundings, created a new Environmental Protection Agency, with tough enforcement powers.

 中国北方的地区政府实施了紧急限制直到明年的三月中旬为的是控制空气污染，那是冬天污染最严重的时候。26个城市包括北京和天津（被当作是一个省的城市）承诺将会用煤作燃料的供热系统改为用电或者天然气给300万的家庭供暖。但他们不能做得到，执行上大转弯：他们允许大量的煤在某地可以燃烧，但却没有其它的替代方案。政府也限制了铁，钢和铝冶炼厂的出口，封存了很多大的建设项目，起重机停在未完工工地的上空——铲土机躺在矢车菊中—— 在北京和其周边城市，用强有力的执法力度建立了一个新的环保署。
 
All countries use a mixture of carrots and sticks in their environmental policies. China does, too (next year it is planning to open the world’s biggest carbon market, For instance). But its sticks—that is, outright bans on polluting activities—are unusually stout. That makes it a good place to judge the impact of command-and-control measures to rein in pollution, as opposed to subsidies or taxes. So far the lesson seems to be that bans work, but only when conditions are right.

 许多国家在环境政策上都使用怀柔政策。中国也一样（比如，明年将计划开放全球最大的碳市场）。但是其惩罚——那就是，完全禁止环境污染——通常都是严厉的。正如反对津贴和税收一样，这使得让指挥和控制的措施产生的影响来控制污染变成一件好事。到目前为止，经验似乎就是禁止生产，但仅仅是因为附合条件。

Fumes, health problems, action Beijing’s emergency measures come on top of an even more sweeping set of prohibitions called the national action plan on air pollution, introduced in 2013. (China loves national action plans; it has lots.) This imposed a nationwide cap on coal use, as well as provincial caps requiring Beijing, for instance, to reduce coal consumption by50% over five years and Tianjin to cut it by 19%. The plan banned new coal-burning facilities (though plants already in the works were allowed) and sped up the use of filters and scrubbers.

 浓烟，健康问题，北京紧急措施的行动，在一系列更全面的禁令中摆在最首要的位置，称之为国家空气污染的行动计划，在2013年出台了。（中国喜欢国家行动，有很多类似的事情。）这个禁令在全国范围内实施，同样省一级也要求和北京一样，比如，在五年里煤消耗要减少20%，天津减少了19%。这个计划禁止使用新的烧煤设备（尽管工厂已经被请允许使用其设备）以及加快过滤器和洗涤器的使用。

The plan seems to be working. The concentration of pollutants with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5—the most deadly kind) fell from over100 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing in 2012-13, at the time of the city’s notorious “airpocalypse”, to around 75 in 2016. That is comparable to London’s clean-up after the “pea soup” fogs of the 1950s, but quicker. It translated, according to Greenpeace, an environmental pressure group, into 160,000 avoided premature deaths in 2016.

计划似乎可行。从2012年到13年，在北京，在这个城市狼籍的“空气末日”里，直径为2.5微米（PM2.5——最致使的一种）或更小的污染物浓度从每平米的100微克开始下降，在2016年PM2.5徘徊在75左右。这可以与上世纪50年代伦敦出现“豌豆汤”式的浓雾后进行的净化行为相比，但更快了。根据绿色和平组织，一个环境保护集团，的说法，在2016年，有16万人避免过早的死亡。

But in 2017 the improvement in PM 2.5 concentrations stopped and the level flattened out. This winter has seen welcome episodes of clear skies but also more days than in 2016 of the worst, choking smog, when daily PM 2.5 levels rise above 300. The annual average level remains about
25% above the target set in the national action plan, and well above the levels that pertain in big Western cities—hence the emergency measures.

 但在2017年，PM2.5浓度的改善情况停止并保留在这个水平上。这个冬季迎来洁净的天空，但也比2016年的情况更糟糕，令人窒息的雾霾，当每天的PM2.5水平突破300时。年度平均水平仍比国家行动计划高出25%，同时，高出的水平部分来自于西部的城市——因此采取了紧急的措施。

Why did bans work at first, then stumble? There are several reasons. First, the measures were more effective when economic change was making China greener anyway, as it was in 2013-16, when the composition of GDP shifted away from heavy industry and infrastructure towards services. But in 2016 the government grew alarmed about an economic slowdown and allowed infrastructure spending to rise again (infrastructure is pollution-intensive because of the amount of cement and steel used in construction). When this happened, the command-and-control measures were unable to do more than stop emissions rising.

 为什么禁令一开始是有效的，后来就难以维系了呢？有几个原因。首先，当经济的改变给中国带来更多好处的时候措施是有效的，当这些发生在2013-16年，当GDP的构成从重工业转移以及由基础设施的建设向服务业转变时。但在2016年经济放缓给政府敲起警钟的时候 ，允许基础设施建设继续保持增长（基础设施建设是高污染行业，因为有大量的水泥和建筑用钢）。当这一切发生的时候，指挥和控制的措施比禁止排放增长更加难以运作。
 
Second, such measures only change polluters’ behaviour as long as they remain permanently in force. Many Chinese steel mills and coalmines (especially small privately-owned ones) ramped up output in the months before the curbs went into effect and did the same again when controls were eased. The stop-start character of the bans made them less effective.

第二，这些措施只能改变污染者的行为，只要他们长期保持这种有效运作。许多中国钢厂和煤矿（特别是私人小煤矿），在这些限制措施生效前，在一个月里开足马力地生产，并且，当管制放松时，同样的情况再次发生了。
 
Third, banning things probably works better in China than it would in most places. Many of the biggest polluters are state-owned enterprises, so the state can more easily control them. An authoritarian government is also able to issue draconian orders—sometimes far too drastic, as the Shivering children of Hebei can testify. The efforts of Xi Jinping, the president, to make local leaders obey the dictates of the central government seem to have turned the former passive resistance at the lower levels of the bureaucracy into over enthusiastic compliance.

 第三，被禁止的事情在中国比其它地方也许能很好地运作。许多大的污染者都是国家企业，所以国家能很好地控制它们。专制政府也能下达严厉的命令——有时下药太猛，河北冷得发抖的孩子们可以证明。习近平主席的努力，让当地的领导服从中央政府的指令似乎让官僚主义的低层官员从以前的消极对抗转变为充满热情的服从。


China has two other advantages. More than half its pollution comes from coalfired power stations, which means that by concentrating on coal, the government can do more than in India, say, where the burning of stubble after harvest and other sorts of pollution are big problems. Unlike most Developing countries, China has invested a Lot in monitoring and measuring, too.

 中国有两个优势。超过一半的污染来自于烧煤的发电站，这意味着要集中用煤，中国政府能做的比印度更多也，就是说，印度在收获后残株的燃烧和其它类型的污染都是大问题。不像大多数的发展中国家，中国在监测和测量方面投入了不少。
 
Last, command-and-control suits a country that does not need to justify the costs. The Clean Air Alliance of China estimated in 2015 that the investment cost of the national action plan in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei provinces alone would be 250bn yuan ($38bn). That does not include the opportunity cost of suspending construction projects for months on end or shutting down some smelters.

 最后，指挥和控制适合并不需要考虑成本的国家。中国清洁空气联盟在2015年成立，其国家行动计划的投资经费单独设在北京，天津和河北省，其将达2500亿人民币（3.8亿美元）。这并不包括连续几个月暂停建设项目的机会成本和关闭一些冶炼厂。
 
But big environmental controls of every kind are expensive. Germany’s Energiewende, for example, which uses subsidies to encourage greener fuels, cost €60bn ($66bn) in 2015 and German carbon emissions have not fallen since 2010. At least in China airborne pollutants fell for five years and the benefits in terms of deaths avoided were real. Now the government needs to show that these gains can continue for more than a few years—without leaving children freezing outside.

但各种各样的环境控制都是昂贵的。德国的能源革命，举个例子，他们用补助去鼓励更环保的燃料，在2015年花费600万欧元（660美元）同时，德国的碳排放量在2010年开始并没有下降。至少中国的空中污染物在过去的五年下降了，避免死亡的各种好处是真实存在的。现在政府需要表明，这些成果能够持续好些年——而在室外并没有被冻着的孩子。
